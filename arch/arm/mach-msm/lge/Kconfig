	  Normally, "suspend" kthread is scheduled as soon as writing "on" to /sys/power/state.
	  But, sometimes "suspend" kthread can't be scheduled in 5~6 second. 
	  This causes black screen in spite of pushing power button.
	  For prevent this, raise scheduling policy of "suspend" kthread to SCHED_FIFO when
	  entering early suspend state, and lower to SCHED_NORMAL when escaping late resume 
	  state
