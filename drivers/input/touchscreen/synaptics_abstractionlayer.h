  /* Interfaces to OEM hardware abstraction and O/S abstraction layers.
   * These functions isolate the O/S and H/W specific implimentations of
   * reading, writing and waiting for ATTN on OEMs hardware physical layer.
   *
   * Additionally there are functions that may need to be specifically
   * tailored for the OEMs Operating System - like Sleep, Print and Exit.
   *
   * The OEM customer impliments their own versions of these functions.
   * These are called by the SynaReflash.c code and since they depend on
   * the OEMs specific hardware and O/S they need to be done by the OEM.
   *
   * There is one simple call to make back to the SynaReflash.c code to do the
   * reflashing - this does not need to be changed by the OEM cusomer and is
   * only called once in the main routine.
